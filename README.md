# salute
Small 'useful' greeting/salutaion framework that exercise's deeper knowledge of key JavaScrip concepts. The project comes out of personal course work/study

salute.js is the main library file. 
  It follows the pattern of JQuery and is a 'project' that comes from a personal study of JQuery itself.

app.js and index.html are supporting actors that show how an app might actually use the library.
